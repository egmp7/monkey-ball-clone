**Title: Unity 3D Graphics Scene Report**

**Introduction:**
This report outlines the development of a 3D graphics scene using Unity, encompassing a baseline requirement and two additional tasks. The tasks involve implementing physics-based interactions, user-controlled object movements, and optional extensions, demonstrating an understanding of computer graphics and animation techniques.

**Baseline: Unity Scene with Rigid Body:**
A Unity scene was created with the inclusion of at least one rigid body. This foundational element serves as a starting point for implementing dynamic interactions within the environment.

---

**Task 1: Physics-based Object Interaction:**
*Techniques Applied:*
To achieve physics-based object interaction, a bouncing ball was introduced. Unity's Rigidbody component was utilized to simulate real-world physics, employing principles such as gravity and collision detection. The implementation relied on the Unity physics engine to calculate forces and respond dynamically to the virtual environment.

*Explanation and Evaluation:*
Physics-based interactions enhance realism, making the scene more immersive. The implementation prioritized the use of rigid body dynamics, aligning with established principles of Newtonian physics. This choice ensures accurate and visually appealing object behavior, surpassing simplistic transform animations.

**Task 2: User-Controlled Object Movement:**
*Techniques Applied:*
A control scheme was implemented to enable user input-based movement. Forces were applied to the object in response to keyboard input, creating a dynamic and responsive interaction. Unity's Input System facilitated the capture of user commands for translation and rotation of the object.

*Explanation and Evaluation:*
The incorporation of user-controlled movement adds an interactive dimension to the scene. The choice to use forces aligns with the physics-based foundation, offering a seamless integration of user input into the virtual world. This approach allows for nuanced control and dynamic responses, contributing to an engaging user experience.

**Extension Task: Physics-based Compound Object:**
*Techniques Applied:*
Unity's joint system was employed to create a compound physics object. Rigid bodies were linked using joints, simulating a cohesive structure with interconnected components.

*Explanation and Evaluation:*
The extension task introduces a more complex physics scenario, demonstrating an understanding of Unity's joint system. Creating a compound object showcases versatility in designing intricate interactions. This approach was preferred over simpler alternatives to challenge the application of physics principles in a more advanced context.

**WebGL Build and Submission:**
A WebGL build of the Unity scene was created and uploaded using the "3.501 Unity Uploader." The link ensures easy access for assessment and peer review.

---

**Conclusion:**
The development of the Unity 3D graphics scene successfully met the baseline and extended to incorporate physics-based interactions and user-controlled movement. The report highlights the strategic application of computer graphics and animation techniques, grounded in theoretical principles, to achieve the desired aesthetic effects.
